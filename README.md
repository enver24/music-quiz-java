# Music Quiz Project ðŸŽµ

A simple quiz game written in Java using **Greenfoot**.  
Built as part of my Programming Fundamentals course.  

## Features
- Two game modes:
  1. **Guess Count Game** â€“ user guesses how many song/artist combos are incorrect.
  2. **Song Quiz Game** â€“ user answers true/false for each combo.
- Uses **arrays, loops, methods, and input validation**.
- Console report cards with scoring and percentage.

## Files
- `src/MusicQuizActor.java` â€“ main Java class (replace [Your Name] and [Your ID] in comments).
- `MusicQuizData.docx` â€“ Word table with the dataset (10 songs, artists, and True/False).

## How to Run
1. Open project in **Greenfoot**.
2. Create a new `MusicQuizActor` and add it to the world.
3. Click **Act** to play the game.
